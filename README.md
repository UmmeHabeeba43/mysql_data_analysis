# mysql_data_analysis
A collection of 13+ sql queries written in MYSQL Workbench as a part of practice project.

## ðŸ“Š Project Overview: Pizza Sales SQL Analysis

This project is a structured SQL analysis of a fictional pizza sales dataset. It began as part of a guided SQL tutorial, but I extended it by designing and writing my own queries to go deeper into the dataset and solidify my understanding of SQL beyond basic examples.

The dataset simulates real-world business data from a pizza restaurant and includes multiple related tables such as:
- `orders`: Order IDs and timestamps
- `order_details`: Quantities and pizza IDs per order
- `pizzas`: Pizza sizes, prices, and types
- `pizza_types`: Categories, names, and ingredients of pizzas

My objective was to extract meaningful insights and perform exploratory analysis using **MySQL Workbench**. I focused on writing efficient and clean SQL queries involving:
- Aggregations (`SUM`, `AVG`, `COUNT`, `MAX`, `MIN`)
- Joins across multiple tables
- Time-based analysis using `DATE()`, `HOUR()`, etc.
- Window functions for cumulative totals
- Grouping and filtering using `GROUP BY`.

The queries answer questions such as:
- What is the total revenue from pizza sales?
- Which pizza types are most and least popular?
- What are the most common pizza sizes?
- How do orders vary by hour of the day?
- What is the trend of daily revenue and cumulative earnings?
- Which pizza categories generate the most revenue?

In total, I created 13+ queries â€” both from the tutorial and my own extensions â€” to explore the data from different angles. This project demonstrates my growing proficiency in SQL and my ability to think analytically with real-world-style datasets.
